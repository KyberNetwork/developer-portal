## What It Does

The library enables 3 use cases:

- **Pay**: Allow users to buy goods or services in your app, paying with any supported tokens
- **Swap**: Allow users to swap between supported token pairs
- **Buy**: Allow users to buy a given token within your app with any supported token they wish.

The library comes with a standard, ready-to-use UI. It also lets developers customize many UI aspects to fit their needs.

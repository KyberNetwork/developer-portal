Kyber's widgets are production-ready code that users can easily embed into their website. By using the widget, users do not need to create their own UI as the widgets are provided with a stock UI. With the integration of the widget, these platforms are able to leverage on the functionality of Kyber's protocol implementation such as native token swaps.

The diagram below shows how you can easy it is to integrate your website with Kyber's widgets to extend your site's functionality.

There are many projects that have been integrated with the protocol implementation using the KyberWidget: namely CoinGecko, Peepeth, Etheremon to name a few. Ren also implemented Kyber's sign-in widget, which utilises the [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) standard to leverage on Kyber's database of KYC-d users.

Websites that utilise the KyberWidget also have the opportunity to join Kyber's *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing for each trade originating from your website. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

## Integrate Your Application
The widgets you can currently integrate with are the [Kyber Widget](integrations-kyberwidgetguide.md) and the [Sign-In Widget](integrations-signinwidgetguide.md).

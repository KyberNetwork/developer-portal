REST APIs have been designed to help users without sufficient smart contract experience to interact with Kyber's protocol implementation. Applications written in a variety of programming languages can now interact with the protocol implementation in a much simpler way than before, thereby extending the functionality of these applications.

The diagram below shows how developers can integrate their applications with some programming experience and [basic knowledge of web3](references-web3.md).

The APIs also provide endpoints for retrieving useful information like [supported tokens](references-tradingapi.md#currencies) and [market volume](references-tradingapi.md#market). For example, Enjin's wallet built-in token swap functionality is enabled via the use of the Trading API.

Applications also have the opportunity to join Kyber's *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing for each trade originating from the application. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

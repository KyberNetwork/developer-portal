![How others can work with Kyber Network](/uploads/kyberusecases.png "Use Cases")

At Kyber, we strongly believe in working together with other players in the ecosystem. Developers can build their own innovative applications and interact with our protocol implementation to leverage the shared liquidity pool â€” creating a world where any token can be used anywhere.

The three main categories of users of the Kyber protocol are:
1. [DApps](integrations-dappsusecase.md)
2. [Vendors](integrations-vendorsusecase.md)
3. [Wallets](integrations-walletsusecase.md)

Click on the links above to learn more about the various use cases.

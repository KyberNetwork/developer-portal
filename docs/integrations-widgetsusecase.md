Our widgets are production-ready code that users can easily embed into their application. The main benefit of using our widgets is that the users do not need to create their own UI as it comes with a stock UI. By integrating our widgets into their application, these platforms are able to achieve the functionalities of our protocol implementation such as native token swaps.

The diagram below shows how you can easy it is to integrate your application with our widgets.

There are many projects that have been integrated with us using our KyberWidget; CoinGecko, Peepeth, Etheremon to name a few. REN also implemented our sign-in widget, which utilises the [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) standard, to leverage on our database of KYC-d users.

Applications also have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each trade that originates from your application. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

## Integrate Your Application
The 2 widgets you can currently integrate with are the [Kyber Widget](integrations-widgetguide.md) and the [Sign-In Widget](integrations-widgetoauth.md).

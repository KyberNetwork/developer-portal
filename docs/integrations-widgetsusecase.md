Users that do not wish to create their own UI but still want to interact with our protocol implementation can take advantage of our widgets. Applications can easily integrate with these widgets to improve their functionalities.

The diagram below shows how you can easily integrate your application with our widgets.

There are many projects that have been integrated with us using our KyberWidget; CoinGecko, Peepeth, Etheremon to name a few. Similarly, REN implemented our sign-in widget, which utilises the [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) standard, to leverage on our database of KYC-d users.

Applications also have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each trade that originates from your application. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

## Integrate Your Application
The 2 widgets you can integrate with are the [Kyber Widget](integrations-widgetguide.md) and the [Sign-In Widget](integrations-widgetoauth.md).

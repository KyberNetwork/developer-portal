The Kyber Protocol enables your wallet the power to do even more. By integrating with our protocol, it allows your users to freely transact and convert without leaving your wallet.

The below diagram shows how Kyber Network can streamline the token conversion swap process for your users.

Popular wallets like MyEtherWallet, imToken and TrustWallet are already using the Kyber Protocol to empower their users.

Wallets have the opportunity to join our Fee Sharing Program, which allows fee sharing on each swap that originates from your wallet. Learn more about the program [here](guide-feesharing.md)!

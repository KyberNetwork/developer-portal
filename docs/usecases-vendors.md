The Kyber protocol empowers businesses and their users with greater flexibility and variety through our seamless token swaps. Our protocol enables customers and businesses to pay and receive payments in their token of choice â€“ all within a single transaction, thus expanding the scope of your business to token users of all kind.

The following diagram indicates how the Kyber Protocol can enhance the experience for your users.

Projects such as Gifto and Request Network will be taking advantage of the Kyber Protocol to allow for payments in a wide range of tokens and currencies.

Vendors have the opportunity to join our Fee Sharing Program, which allows fee sharing on each payment that originates from your payment gateway. Learn more about the program [here](guide-feesharing.md)!

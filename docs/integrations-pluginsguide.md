## Prerequisites
* PHP version 7.2+
* WordPress 3.8+
* WooCommerce 3.0+

## Step 1: Installing the plugin
### Option A: Clone Github Repo Source
1. Clone the code repo to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

## Step 2: Activating the plugin
Activate the plugin in `/wp-admin/plugins.php`. After activation, you will find the plugin settings in your WordPress Dashboard under the WooCommerce->Payment section. Enabling the plugin will add an option to pay with tokens on the checkout page.


## Step 3: Configure the plugin
The configuration in this plugin is based on the widget configuration from the [Widget Generator](https://developer.kyber.network/docs/WidgetGenerator/), and is modified to fit the WooCommerce model.

When the user pays for his shopping cart using the Kyber Payment Gateway option, the KyberWidget will handle the rest of the process. The user will be able to pay using any tokens supported by Kyber, while you (the vendor) will receive the payment in the token of your choice.

The widget returns the transaction hash for the payment, which is used by the plugin for checking the transaction status.

## Order Status
When the transaction succeeds, the order status will change from `On-Hold` to `Processing`. At this stage, the website admin or vendor will receive a notification about the successful payment of the cart, and will start processing the shipment of the products.

Should the transaction fail, the order status changes from `On-Hold` to `Failed`.

### Order Flow
The order's status follows the [Managing Orders](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/) flow from WooCommerce. However, when the order is in `On-Hold` status, this plugin will monitor the transaction hash using the [monitor-eth-tx](https://packagist.org/packages/tranbaohuy/monitor-eth-tx/) library.

The order status flow is summarised below.
`Order created` -> `Pending payment` -> `On-Hold` (payment broadcasted & mornitored) -> `Processing` (successful payment) OR `Failed` (failed payment)

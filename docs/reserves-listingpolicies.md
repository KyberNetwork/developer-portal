## Requirements to be listed on KyberSwap.com

There are few requirements to have your token listed on Kyber Network:

1. The token is an ERC20 token.

2. Legal opinion that the token is a **utility token**, based on Malta law.

3. The legal opinion should come from a licensed Law Firm in its respective jurisdiction.

4. Liquidity has to be provided for the token. This is done by being a permissioned token reserve, or by using an existing 3rd party reserve that is already integrated with Kyber.

5. Complete [this listing form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KJfKn3oFhz_puutC5ciQPiPMJlJ1JSKEIjD3t5HKC-8/edit)

6. A **deposit of USD $1000 worth of KNC** as commitment towards this listing process, because considerable effort is required on both parties. The funds will be returned once the token goes live on KyberSwap.


## Policies

* **Transparency**: All operations that occur on the Kyber protocol can be publicly verified on the blockchain.

* **Non-custodial**: At no point does the Kyber protocol control the funds of its users. Hence, users' funds will not be affected even in hacking incidents.

* **Instant Confirmation**: A transaction happens with instant confirmation if it's sent from on-chain entities like smart contracts. Otherwise, once the transaction is included on the blockchain, the execution triggered by the transaction is immediately confirmed.

* **Operation Certainty**: There are no transactional risks. Users know the rate and how much liquidity is available before they commit their transaction. There is no settlement uncertainty or counterparty risk.

* **On-chain Settlement**: Atomic and immediate on-chain settlement of trades.

* **Reserve Managers control their reserves**: Reserves also keep and contribute liquidity for their token via smart contracts that they control (source code prepared, tested and provided by us).

* **Code Audits**: Kyberâ€™s smart contracts have also been audited and verified by [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/), an audit platform for smart contracts. Read the full audit report here: <NEW_AUDIT_LINK>

## Plugin Parameters

| `Description` | Describe what the payment gateway is for. It will be displayed under the payment options. | Pay with tokens |

## Transaction Monitoring
In order to check if the payment is successful, we use the [widget-monitor-php](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/widget-monitor-php) library to monitor the transaction.

This plugin will retrieve the transaction receipt from the blockchain and return its status as well as validate the payment. It provides 2 modes for monitoring the tx status: `useIntervalLoop` or none. The `useIntervalLoop` plugin will continuously query a node to get the tx receipt until it reaches the desired block confirmation number. Note that this approach will consume a lot of server resources if there are many orders on-hold and block confirmation numbers are large.

We recommend using a cronjob to check the order tx status periodically. We are already using wp_cron to monitor every 30 seconds. You can install and use WP Crontrol to view and edit that job.

### Advanced Options
The cron jobs above will run upon every page load. This approach has 2 main issues:
1) As with any heavy job, it will slow down the page for users
2) It is dependent on the user request to run the cronjob. Therefore, it is recommended to disable the WordPress default cronjob and setup a Linux (server) cronjob using crontab.

Here is a guide on how to do this:

1. Install crontab (if your server does not have it as default). You may need to search for instructions for your distro (Centos, RHEL, etc).

2. Setup crontab.

```sh
crontab -e
```

3. Add the following line in order to run every minute to check the tx status.

```sh
curl http://example.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Please make sure you use the correct path to wp-cron.php.

Alternatively, you can use WP-cli

```sh
cd /var/www/example.com/htdocs; wp cron event run --due-now > /dev/null 2>&1
```

4. You will need to disable WordPress default wp-cron. Add following to wp-config.php.
```php
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
```

5. Finally, restart crontab service so the new job can run.
```sh
sudo service cron restart
```

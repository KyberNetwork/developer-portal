Kyber Network’s technology is open source and can be freely integrated into your DApp without any fees. This will grant your users access to our fast, convenient and trustless token conversion and transfer service. The increased interchangeability of tokens not only improves your platform’s functionality, but also enhances your users' experiences.

The below diagram indicates your DApps can have better user experiences by using Kyber.

Integrating with our protocol can benefit your DAPP in many ways. For example, ETHLend allows instant liquidation of assets in case of defaulted loans or collateral calling without leaving the ETHLend DApp. Financial DApps like Olympus Labs allows users to invest in different tokens with just a few taps within the app.

DApps have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each swap that originates from your app. Learn more about the program [here](guide-feesharing.md)!

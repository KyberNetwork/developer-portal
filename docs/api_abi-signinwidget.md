## Developer Registration
Contact one of our Kyber developers in the KyberDeveloper group at https://t.me/KyberDeveloper to get a developer account. The following information is required:
| Parameter            | Description |
| -------------------  |:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Name                 | Application name that will be displayed to the user when asked for login permissions |
| Redirect URI         | The URI that Kyber's servers will redirect the users to and that will handle the data that Kyber passes; you can possibly provide multiple URIs, but they must be HTTPS (You can use ngrok or localtunel to create https uris for testing) |
| Icon                 | An icon in SVG format with 1024x1024 resolution |

You will then be provided with 2 items:
1. `APP_ID`, which is considered public and will be used in your public-facing code.
2. `APP_SECRET` to be kept secret and used only on the server side.

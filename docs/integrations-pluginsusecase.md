There are many projects that have been integrated with us using our KyberWidget; CoinGecko, Peepeth, Etheremon to name a few. Similarly, REN implemented our sign-in widget, which utilises the [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) standard, to leverage on our database of KYC-d users.

Applications also have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each trade that originates from your application. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

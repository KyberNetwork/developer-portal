## FAQ

1. I specify popup/iframe mode, but when user clicks payment button, the browser opens the widget in new tab?

**Answer:**

If your buttons do not have ‘kyber-widget-button’ class, or they are generated on the fly when the page already loaded, you need to manually activate the buttons as following:

```javascript
window.kyberWidgetOptions.register(‘your buttons CSS selector here’);
```
If you don’t provide the CSS selector, it defaults to ‘kyber-widget-button’.

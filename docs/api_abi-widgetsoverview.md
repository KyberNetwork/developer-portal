title: Widgets Overview

Widgets are a type of integration that websites and applications can easily leverage on to interact with our protocol implementation. There are currently 2 types of widgets. The first is the KyberWidget that extends your platform's functionality with decentralised token swaps. It can be implemented in [HTML/JS](api_abi-kyberwidget.md#kyberwidget-html-js) or [iOS](api_abi-kyberwidget.md#kyberwidget-ios). The second is the [Sign In Widget](api_abi-signinwidget.md) that allows users who are registered with us to log into your platform.

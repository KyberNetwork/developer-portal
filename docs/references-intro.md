## Overview
The Reference section provides in-depth information and documentation about Kyber Network's smart contracts, RESTful APIs, Widgets and Plugins.

The [smart contracts](references-kybernetworkproxy.md) define the Kyber protocol and allow users to do decentralised token swaps while the [RESTful APIs](references-restfulapioverview.md) give users (without much smart contract knowledge) the ability to interact with our smart contracts. [Widgets](references-widgetsoverview.md) and [Plugins](references-pluginsoverview.md) are straightforward approaches that can be implemented on your application to provide token swap functionality to your platforms.

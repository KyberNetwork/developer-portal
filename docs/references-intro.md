## Overview IS INCOMPLETE PLEASE DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER



The Reference section provides in-depth information and documentation about Kyber Network's smart contracts and RESTful APIs. The smart contracts define the Kyber protocol and allow users to do decentralised token swaps while the RESTful APIs give users (without much smart contract knowledge) the ability to interact with our smart contracts.

If you wish to learn more about the specifications of our smart contracts, please refer to this [section](references-smartcontractoverview.md). Additionally, more details about our RESTful API can be found [here](references-restfulapioverview.md).

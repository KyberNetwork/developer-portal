## Introduction
The KyberWidget is a straightforward approach that websites can leverage on to setup a friendly stock user interface; thus expanding the functionality of their platforms by allowing their users to interact with our smart contract implementation.

## Overview
In this guide, we will be covering how you can integrate your website with the KyberWidget.

## Things to note
1) There are 3 different widget types:

- `Pay` caters to e-commerce sites and vendors who would like to receive cryptocurrencies as payment.
- `Swap` targets parties who wish to provide swapping services on their websites.
- `Buy` is used by platforms who want to allow users to buy a specific token on their website.

2) There are also 3 different display modes that are supported:

- `Popup` will open the widget as an overlay popup. The widget will be inserted directly into the host page's DOM. Use this mode if you want to customize the widget appearance by overriding CSS rules.
- `New Tab` will open the widget in a new browser tab.
- `iFrame` will open the widget inside an iFrame on an overlay popup. Use this mode if you prefer the widget's UI and don't want to override its CSS.

3) The widget generator used in this guide is not mandatory; it merely provides a quick way to specify the required parameters and settings.
4) The button's text, title, and CSS style can be changed if desired.
5) You can add multiple buttons into a page for multiple functionalities.

## FAQ

1. Even though I specified the popup / iframe mode, why does the browser open the widget in a new tab when the user clicks on the payment button?

**Answer:**

If your buttons do not have the ‘kyber-widget-button’ class, or they are generated on the fly when the page is already loaded, you need to manually activate the buttons as such:

```javascript
window.kyberWidgetOptions.register(‘your buttons CSS selector here’);
```
If you don’t provide the CSS selector, it defaults to ‘kyber-widget-button’.

2. How do I track or monitor the payment status?

**Answer:**
Onee may refer to [this monitoring PHP library](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/widget-monitor-php). More monitoring tools may be built by Kyber and the community in the future. Alternatively, vendors can choose to implement and run their own monitoring logic to get the payment status from the Ethereum network.

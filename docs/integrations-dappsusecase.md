Interacting with Kyber's protocol implementation grants your users to Kyber's fast, convenient and trustless token conversion and transfer services. The increased interchangeability of tokens not only improves your platform’s functionality, but also enhances your users' experiences.

The diagram below explains how DApps can leverage on Kyber's protocol implementation to improve their functionality and user experience.

With Kyber, financial DApps like ETHLend allows instant liquidation of assets in case of defaulted loans or collateral calling without leaving the DApp. Gaming DApps like Etheremon enable users to buy NFT monsters with any tokens of their choice directly on their platform.

DApps also have the opportunity to incorporate a own commission fee into trades. Learn more about platform fees [here](integrations-platformfees.md)!

## Integrate Your DApp
The common methods existing DApps use to integrate with our protocol implementation are through their own **smart contracts** and the **ethers.js** or web3.js libraries. Explore the [smart contract](integrations-smartcontractguide.md) and [ethers.js](integrations-ethersguide.md) guides to learn more!

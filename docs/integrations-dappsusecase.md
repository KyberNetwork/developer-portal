Interacting with Kyber's protocol implementation grants your users to Kyber's fast, convenient and trustless token conversion and transfer services. The increased interchangeability of tokens not only improves your platformâ€™s functionality, but also enhances your users' experiences.

The diagram below explains how DApps can leverage on Kyber's protocol implementation to improve their functionality and user experience.

DApps like ETHLend allows instant liquidation of assets in case of defaulted loans or collateral calling without leaving the ETHLend DApp while Financial DApps like Olympus Labs allows users to invest in different tokens with just a few taps within the app.

DApps also have the opportunity to join Kyber's *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing for each trade originating from your DApp. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

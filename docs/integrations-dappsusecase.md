Interacting with our protocol implementation grants your users to our fast, convenient and trustless token conversion and transfer services. The increased interchangeability of tokens not only improves your platformâ€™s functionality, but also enhances your users' experiences.

The diagram below explains how DApps can leverage on our protocol implementation to improve their functionality and user experience.

DApps like ETHLend allows instant liquidation of assets in case of defaulted loans or collateral calling without leaving the ETHLend DApp while Financial DApps like Olympus Labs allows users to invest in different tokens with just a few taps within the app.

DApps also have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each swap that originates from your app. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

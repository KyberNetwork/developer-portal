Kyber is a fully on-chain liquidity protocol that can be implemented on any EDCC (a.k.a smart contract) enabled blockchain. Our implementation of the Kyber protocol aggregates liquidity from diverse sources into a single pool, which in turn provides a single endpoint for takers to perform multiple token swaps in a single blockchain transaction.

Moreover, our implementation can be easily integrated into any applications thereby enabling value exchanges to be performed seamlessly between all parties in the ecosystem.

You can learn more about the Kyber protocol specifications, our implementation of the protocol, the various integration use cases and guides on this website.

## Navigation
- Get started by reading the [design principles](home-designprinciples.md) of the Kyber protocol.
- To learn about the common integration use cases and how you can integrate your application, head over to the [integrations section](integrations-intro.md).
- Read our [reserve overview](reserves-intro.md) to understand how reserves provide liquidity to the entire network and how you can join as one.
- If you're looking for our contract addresses or ABIs, the [environments section](environments-intro.md) is where you want to be.
- The [references section](references-intro.md)contains detailed documentation of our smart contracts, APIs, and more!

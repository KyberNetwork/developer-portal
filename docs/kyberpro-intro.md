At Kyber Network, we have been market making on-chain since our inception with consistently high profits. We have also helped onboard and support other market makers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With our deep expertise in this field, and in collaboration with the Chicago DeFi Alliance, we have formalised a new framework called ‘KyberPRO’ that aims to help professional market makers operate profitably on the blockchain and serves as a bridge between traditional market making and the world of DeFi.

## What is KyberPRO?

KyberPRO is an end-to-end framework that provides the most robust and proven liquidity system (Kyber’s Fed Price Reserve) for professional market making, along with the required tools, documentation, and technical material to allow market makers to easily get started and run a profitable on-chain operation with minimal smart contract knowledge.

In addition, Kyber will provide close guidance to market makers, helping them to set up the right infrastructure, overcome the learning curve, and offer any assistance they might need. Around the middle of November, an incentive program will also be launched to encourage market makers to take the first step towards on-chain market making.

## Who should use KyberPRO?

The KyberPRO framework is specially designed for market makers, by market makers. While market making on-chain allows for higher profit margins compared to off-chain systems and is the only way to provide liquidity for popular DeFi applications, it can be complex for new entrants. KyberPRO aims to remove barriers to entry for on-chain market makers and help them be as profitable as possible. By catering to their specific requirements and streamlining operations, KyberPRO will save substantial resources for market makers during both reserve setup and management, help maximise profits, and optimise their overall performance.

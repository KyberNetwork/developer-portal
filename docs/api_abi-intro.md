## Overview
The API/ABI section provides in-depth information and documentation about Kyber Network's smart contracts & ABIs, RESTful APIs, Widgets and Plugins.

The [smart contracts](api_abi-kybernetworkproxy.md) define the Kyber protocol and allow users to do decentralised token swaps while the [RESTful APIs](api_abi-restfulapioverview.md) give users (without much smart contract knowledge) the ability to interact with our smart contracts. [Widgets](api_abi-widgetsoverview.md) and [Plugins](api_abi-pluginsoverview.md) are straightforward approaches that can be implemented on your application to provide token swap functionality to your platforms.

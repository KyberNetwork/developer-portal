Plugins, like Widgets, are another type of integration that can be easily implemented on any e-commerce websites. Currently, there's one type of Widget which is our [WooCommerce Widget](api_abi-woocommerceplugin.md). Our WooCommerce plugin is an [extension](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/) of the standard WooCommerce plugin, enabling a new payment gateway for the e-commerce websites that are using our plugin.

Users of these e-commerce websites can now pay in any token while the owner receives the payment in any token of their choice.

## Introduction
Widgets are a type of integration that websites and applications can easily leverage on to interact with our protocol implementation. There are currently 2 types of widgets; the KyberWidget that extends your platform's functionality with decentralised token swaps and the Sign In Widget that allows users who are registered with us to log into your platform.

## Overview
There are a total of 3 tutorials that will be covered in this guide; the first is a [HTML / JS KyberWidget](integrations-widgetsguide.md#kyberwidget-html-js) integration guide, the second is an [iOS KyberWidget](integrations-widgetsguide.md#kyberwidget-ios) integration guide and the last will be a guide on using the [Sign In Widget](integrations-widgetsguide.md#sign-in-widget). Please select the tutorial that is most appropriate for you.

Our protocol implementation empowers businesses and their users with greater flexibility and variety through seamless token swaps, enabling customers and vendors to pay and receive payments in their token of choice – all within a single transaction.

The following diagram indicates how the protocol implementation can enhance the experience for your users.

Projects such as Gifto and Request Network will be taking advantage of our protocol implementation to allow for payments in a wide range of tokens and currencies.

Vendors also have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each payment that originates from your payment gateway. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

Reserves provide liquidity to the protocol by committing a diverse range of tokens. They comprise of a wide spectrum of parties, ranging from project teams looking to list their tokens, to professional market makers with customised trading strategies and even developers looking to build new reserve types or integrate their existing DApps.

The key benefit reserves provide is *instant liquidity*. Takers such as DApps, vendors and wallets that integrate the protocol are able to immediately convert one token to another because of the liquidity made readily available by reserves.

Makers provide liquidity to the protocol by contributing a diverse range of tokens. Makers are comprised of a wide range of parties, from project teams looking to list their tokens, to professional market makers with customised trading strategies and even developers looking to build new reserve types.

There are currently 3 ways that anyone can help contribute liquidity to the network. Users with technical skills can choose to create their own reserve type and aggregate liquidity from other liquidity sources such as [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/UniswapExchange/status/1092821767134035968). Alternatively, a non technical user can opt for one of the predefined reserve types that have already been created, such as our [Automated Price Reserve](reserves-automatedpricereserve.md). Lastly, one may also decide to contribute their tokens directly to an existing reserve like loaning your tokens to Kyber or a professional market maker to market make on your behalf.

The key benefit reserves provide is *instant liquidity*. Takers such as DApps, vendors and wallets that integrate the protocol are able to immediately convert one token to another because of the liquidity made readily available by reserves.

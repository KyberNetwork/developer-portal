A project that is looking to integrate with Kyber has 5 different avenues to interact with the protocol implementation. These approaches are as follows:

| Integration Type | Example |
|:----------------:|:-------:|
| `Smart Contracts` | Etheremon's wrapper contract allows their users to be able to buy NFT monsters in any tokens. |
| `Web3` | Easwap is a swapping service that is powered by web3 interactions with our protocol implementation. |
| `RESTful APIs` | Enjin's wallet built-in token swap functionality is enabled via the use of the RESTful API. |
| `Widgets` | CoinGecko allows users to buy any supported ERC20 tokens directly from their website through the KyberWidget. |
| `Plugins` | Hodlmoon uses our variant of the WooCommerce plugin to accept and receive payments in any supported ERC20 token. |

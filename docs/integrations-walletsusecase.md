Wallets that have been integrated with our protocol implementation enables their users to do even more. Users can perform embedded token swaps without having to transfer their funds out of their wallets to another exchange to do the conversion. 

The diagram below shows how wallets can streamline the token swap conversion process for their users.

Popular wallets like MyEtherWallet, imToken and TrustWallet are already using our protocol implementation to empower their users.

Wallets also have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each swap that originates from your wallet. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

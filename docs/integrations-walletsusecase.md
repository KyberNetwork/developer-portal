Wallets that have been integrated with Kyber's protocol implementation enables their users to do even more. Users can now perform embedded token swaps without having to transfer their funds out of their wallets.

The diagram below shows how wallets can streamline the token swap process for their users by integrating with Kyber's protocol implementation.

Popular wallets like MyEtherWallet, imToken and TrustWallet are already using Kyber's protocol implementation to empower their users with embedded token swap functionality.

Wallets also have the opportunity to join Kyber's *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing for each swap originating from your wallet. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

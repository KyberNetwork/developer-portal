REST APIs have been designed to help users without much smart contract experience interact with our protocol implementation. Applications written in a variety of programming languages can now integrate in a much simpler way than before.

The diagram below shows how developers can integrate their applications with only [basic understanding of web3](references-web3.md).

Enjin's wallet built-in token swap functionality is enabled via the use of the trading API. The APIs also provide endpoints for retrieving useful information like [supported tokens](references-tradingapi.md#currencies) and [market volume](references-tradingapi.md#market).

Applications also have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each trade that originates from your application. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

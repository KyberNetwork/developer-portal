REST APIs have been designed to help users without much smart contract experience interact with our protocol implementation. Applications written in a variety of programming languages can now integrate in a much simpler way than before. 

The diagram below shows how developers can integrate their applications with only [basic understanding of web3](references-web3.md).

Enjin's wallet in-built token swap functionality is enabled via the use of the trading API.

Applications also have the opportunity to join our *Fee Sharing Program*, which allows fee sharing on each trade that originates from your application. Learn more about the program [here](integrations-feesharing.md)!

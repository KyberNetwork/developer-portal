## Introduction

The Dynamic Market Maker (DMM) is an all new protocol developd by the Kyber team, which provides frictionless crypto liquidity with high capital efficiency and dynamic fees.

DMM's core improvement lies on its flexible fee adjustment and dynamic pricing curve setups. The flexible fee approach helps reduce the impact of impermanent loss, while different pricing curve setups tailored particularly to the token pairs in the pool allows better capital efficiency.

The full documentation of the DMM can be found in [http://docs.dmm.exchange/](http://docs.dmm.exchange/).
